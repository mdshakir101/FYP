Week 1: 01/10/2024 - 06/10/2024
This week was mostly about getting started with the project. I worked on understanding the project scope and objectives by reviewing the FYP guidelines and discussing initial ideas with the team. We also had our first meeting to finalize our roles and responsibilities. I focused on researching existing auction platforms to understand their key features and limitations.

Completion Status: 40% of project proposal completed
Obstacles: Some technical aspects of auction systems were complex to understand without actual implementation.
Workaround: Discussed with teammates and researched existing implementations to get a clearer understanding.

Week 3: 14/10/2024 - 20/10/2024
Focused on finalizing the project proposal and preparing for submission. Also started creating UML diagrams and database schema drafts. Participated in a team meeting to refine the scope and implementation strategy.

Workaround: Split tasks among team members and scheduled an additional review session.

Week 4: 21/10/2024 - 27/10/2024
Finalized and submitted the project proposal. Began detailed system design, including refining UML diagrams and finalizing the database schema. Conducted research on best practices for database indexing and query optimization.
Completion Status: UML diagrams 80% completed, database schema 50% completed
Obstacles: Some data relationships were difficult to structure efficiently.
Workaround: Took feedback from team discussions and supervisor to improve the schema design.

Week 5: 28/10/2024 - 04/11/2024
Worked on setting up the initial backend infrastructure. Designed the database tables and implemented authentication using JWT and 2FA. Tested basic API endpoints for user registration and login.
Completion Status: Backend authentication 60% completed
Obstacles: Faced minor issues with 2FA implementation due to API configuration.
Workaround: Referred to documentation and debugged using test cases.

Week 6: 05/11/2024 - 11/11/2024
Completed backend authentication and started working on listing API endpoints. Implemented CRUD operations for auction listings and integrated them with the database. Conducted initial testing on API responses.
Completion Status: Listings API 50% completed
Obstacles: Some endpoints required additional validation logic to prevent incorrect data entry.
Workaround: Implemented server-side validation rules and refined error handling.

Week 7: 12/11/2024 - 18/11/2024
Began frontend development for user authentication and account management. Designed and implemented login, registration, and profile update pages in React.js.
Completion Status: Frontend authentication 70% completed
Obstacles: Some UI components were not rendering correctly due to state management issues.
Workaround: Debugged the issue and restructured component logic for better state handling.

Week 8: 19/11/2024 - 25/11/2024
Integrated authentication API with frontend. Conducted testing to ensure smooth login/logout flows. Worked on implementing search and filtering functionalities for auction listings.
Completion Status: Frontend authentication 100%, search/filtering 40% completed
Obstacles: Filtering logic was not working as expected due to incorrect query parameters.
Workaround: Adjusted API queries and tested different filter combinations to ensure accuracy.

Week 9: 26/11/2024 - 02/12/2024
Started implementing WebSocket functionality for real-time bidding. Set up a WebSocket server and integrated it with the existing auction system.
Completion Status: WebSocket integration 50% completed
Obstacles: Some connection issues when multiple users placed bids simultaneously.
Workaround: Adjusted WebSocket event handling and tested with different concurrency levels.

Week 10: 03/12/2024 - 10/12/2024
Completed real-time auction system and tested live bidding functionalities. Worked on implementing auction strategies (English, Dutch, Sealed-bid).
Completion Status: Auction logic 80% completed
Obstacles: Some edge cases caused incorrect bid placements.
Workaround: Refactored bid validation logic and added additional test cases.
