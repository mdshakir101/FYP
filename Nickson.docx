Project Diary - Individual Reflection
________________________________________
Week 1: 01/10/2024 - 06/10/2024
This week, our team kicked off the project by getting acquainted and defining our roles. In our initial meeting, we finalized individual responsibilities, and I took on the frontend lead role. Additionally, I researched existing auction platforms to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and key features, ensuring our project aligns with the guidelines, scope, and objectives. We also cross-referenced multiple sources to gain a deeper understanding of each platform's functionality.

Week 2: 07/10/2024 - 13/10/2024
For this week, I made progress on the project proposal document, outlining key system requirements and collaborating with the team to define functional and non-functional needs. I also delved into researching various frontend development suitable for our development as some technical aspects of the auction system are difficult to grasp, I addressed this challenge by discussing with my team members and exploring existing implementation to gain a better understanding for example, using react.

Week 3: 14/10/2024 - 20/10/2024
I have prioritized finalizing the project proposal and preparing it for submission. To ensure its completion, tasks were delegated among team members, and an additional review session was held. I took on the task of outlining the development methodology and roles and responsibilities, gaining valuable insights into the Waterfall approach. A collaborative team meeting helped refine the project's scope and implementation strategy, with everyone contributing their expertise and support.

Week 4: 21/10/2024 - 27/10/2024
Following the submission of the project proposal, I shifted my focus to the frontend development. I began designing the user interface and user experience, creating wireframes and mock-ups. Research on responsive design and accessibility best practices was also conducted. Despite challenges in structuring complex layout relationships, valuable feedback from team discussions enabled me to refine the design. This input ensured a more intuitive and user-friendly interface. Progress on the frontend design is ongoing.

Week 5: 28/10/2024 - 04/11/2024
This week, I focused on developing the frontend for user registration and login, seamlessly integrating it with the existing backend API. I designed and developed intuitive UI components for registration and login forms, ensuring a smooth user experience. Additionally, I thoroughly tested the API endpoints for user registration and login functionality, identifying and addressing any issues that arose.
Although I encountered minor issues with API request handling and error messaging, I was able to resolve them by referencing YouTube videos and utilizing browser developer tools for debugging. With these obstacles overcome, I am confident in the progress made and look forward to completing the remaining tasks.

Week 6: 05/11/2024 - 11/11/2024
I successfully completed the frontend registration and login functionality, marking a significant milestone. Next, I shifted my focus to developing the individual user page and securing route protection for the user homepage and main page when a user is logged in. This involved implementing authentication checks and authorization logic to ensure that only authorized users can access specific pages. With this feature in place, the application's security and usability have been significantly enhanced, providing a better overall user experience.

Week 7: 12/11/2024 - 18/11/2024
However, I encountered some challenges with UI components not rendering correctly due to state management issues. After debugging the problem, I restructured the component logic to improve state handling, ensuring a seamless user experience. With this enhancement, users can now effortlessly navigate and manage their accounts.________________________________________

Week 8: 19/11/2024 - 25/11/2024

I continued to enhance the frontend by integrating additional features, with a focus on designing and implementing intuitive UI components for the bidding process. This involved creating interactive elements, such as buttons, forms, and real-time bidding updates, to provide a seamless and engaging user experience. The bidding process UI components are now fully integrated, enabling users to effortlessly place bids and track auction activity. This significant milestone brings the application closer to its completion, with a robust and user-friendly bidding system in place.

Week 10: 03/12/2024 - 09/12/2024
I began implementing WebSocket functionality on the frontend to enable real-time bidding updates. I successfully established a connection to the WebSocket server and integrated it with the existing auction system. Although the WebSocket integration is only 50% complete, I've made significant progress. However, I encountered some connection issues when multiple users placed bids simultaneously, which affected the frontend's performance. To address this, I adjusted the WebSocket event handling on the frontend and conducted thorough testing with different concurrency levels to ensure a seamless user experience.

Week 11: 10/12/2024 - 16/12/2024
