Project Diary - Individual Reflection
________________________________________
Week 1: 01/10/2024 - 06/10/2024 
This week, I mostly research about our project requirements, understanding the auction platform as well as examples of existing auction platforms. We also had our first meeting to understand about the process of handling the project and know the strengths and weaknesses of our teammates so as to familiarize with each other’s strengths and weaknesses. 
For obstacles, it was mostly having issue with finding out the different auction platform and understanding their features as I am not a frequent user of auction platforms. 
However, the review of users on auction platforms does help in understanding what are the problems faced in that particular auction platform and research can be done on how we can avoid it. 
Completion Status: 20% of research done 

Week 2: 07/10/2024 - 13/10/2024 
I started a draft of the project proposal document and taking notes of the key points that is needed such as features that are feasible and how to be different from other auction platforms. 
For obstacles, it was difficult finding out features that are unique and feasible to be included in our auction platform as majority of the features are complicated and takes some time to understand how it works. 
However, with more research as well as discussing feasible features with my teammates, we are able to broaden our view by looking at the ideas in a different point of view.
