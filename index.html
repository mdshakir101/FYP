    <h1>FYP-24-S4-37P</h1>
    <p>(1) The project website is COMPULSORY for all FYP teams (i.e. a certain weightage is given to this!)

        (2) The website is ... literally a website, not some Cloud Storage / Google Drive / Dropbox account!
        a) It should be hosted externally, with a URL that can be easily accessed by Assessor/Supervisor 
        b) no restriction on using "free hosting" places like AWS, blogspot, etc. 
        
        (3) Serves the following purposes : 
        a) "Introduction" to your FYP topic, your team members, roles/responsibilities, project objectives
        b) "Administrative update", where team members regularly upload their project meeting minutes, project schedule/gantt charts, individual reflective diaries
        c) "Marketing tool" - a bit of advertising for your FYP system, explaining: 
            - your project's USP, (e.g. offering feature/functions not found/v. expensive in competitor system?)
            - how it makes your user's job/workflow more convenient, %-tage increase their productivity, time savings, etc?
            - for FYP projects implementing "multimedia games", advertise your main characters, special weapons/equipment, unique combat system, cinematic trailers, fantastic scenaries, etc.
        
        (4) Perlimiary Website should be ready up and ready within 3rd week of FYP Start Date
